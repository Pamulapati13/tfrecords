# Using Tfrecords in Tensorlfow 

We can use tfrecords to set the input pipeline to train a model. More information about tfrecords can be found 
[here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord).

In this Repo, we look at ways to save data in tfrecords format and use them to train machine learning
models.
